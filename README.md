# Strategy Pattern
Suppose we have three types of characters in a GameApp:

1. Knight: Attacks with a sword; uses 3 strategies to defend (shield, dodge, magic barrier)
2. Wizard: Casts spells; uses magic barrier to defend
3. Archer: Shoots arrows; uses dodge to defend

## Implement Two Types of Strategy

### A. DefenseStrategy
1. Shield
2. Dodge
3. CreateMagic

### B. AttackStrategy
1. CastSpell
2. ShootArrow
3. SwingSword
